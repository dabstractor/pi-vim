# architecture

How pi-vim is put together: the module/ownership map, the modal state
machine, and the input-dispatch pipeline. This is the high-level map for
review and onboarding; behavior details live in the `README.md` reference
and the per-behavior tests under `test/`.

pi-vim is one `ModalEditor` class (in `index.ts`) that subclasses Pi's
`CustomEditor`, plus a ring of small single-purpose modules it delegates
to. The class owns all mutable editor state and the key-dispatch loop; the
modules are either pure range/string logic, render helpers, or the
side-effecting host integrations (clipboard, mode-change shell hooks).

Every arrow is a direct `import`. The graph is acyclic and one-directional:
`index.ts` depends on everything; nothing depends on `index.ts`. `types.ts`
and `settings.ts` are the shared leaves. The `pure` and `render` modules
hold no editor state (`mode-label`, `input-keys`, `cursor-shape`,
`motions`, `text-objects` are free functions), which is what makes them
safe to unit-test in isolation and to move out of the class without
changing behavior.

## modal state machine

`this.mode` is one of `"insert"`, `"normal"`, `"visual"`, or
`"visual-line"`. EX mini-mode is not a fifth `Mode`: it is
`this.mode === "normal"` with `pendingExCommand !== null`.
`getActiveMode()` reports `"ex"` for border/label coloring and folds both
visual modes onto `"normal"`, so EX entry/exit and visual entry/exit reuse
the normal-mode colors. Mode-change shell hooks *do* fire on visual
transitions (they receive `"visual"` / `"visual-line"` and run the
`modeChange.normal` command) but not on EX entry/exit. Within normal mode,
several short-lived *pending* sub-states capture the next key(s) of a
multi-key command.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Insert
    Insert --> Normal: Esc
    Normal --> Insert: i a o O A I s S C ...
    Normal --> Ex: ":"
    Ex --> Normal: Enter submits / Esc cancels
    Normal --> Visual: v
    Normal --> VisualLine: V
    Visual --> Normal: Esc / v / d x y
    VisualLine --> Normal: Esc / V / d x y
    Visual --> VisualLine: V
    VisualLine --> Visual: v
    Visual --> Insert: c / s / C / S
    VisualLine --> Insert: c / s / C / S

    state Normal {
        [*] --> Ready
        Ready --> OperatorPending: d / c / y
        Ready --> MotionPending: f / F / t / T
        Ready --> ReplacePending: r
        Ready --> GPending: g
        OperatorPending --> Ready: motion or text-object resolves / aborts
        MotionPending --> Ready: target char
        ReplacePending --> Ready: replacement char
        GPending --> Ready: second key
    }

    note right of Ex
        pendingExCommand holds the ":..." buffer.
        this.mode is still "normal"; only the
        active-mode color/label read as "ex".
    end note

    note right of Visual
        visualAnchor holds the position where
        v / V was pressed. Motions move only the
        cursor; the selection is the pair.
    end note
```

Counts (`prefixCount`, `operatorCount`) accumulate alongside these pending
states and are consumed by `takeTotalCount()`, which combines a prefix count
and an operator count — multiplying when both are present — and clamps the
result to `MAX_COUNT`.

## input-dispatch pipeline

`handleInput(data)` is the single entry point for every keystroke. Two
pre-passes run before the main dispatch: EX input normalization (the paste
/ newline wait policy, which prevents a pasted line from auto-submitting)
and bracketed-paste stripping in normal mode. The main dispatch is then
wrapped in `prepareRepeatRecordingForInput` / `finishRepeatRecordingAfterInput`
(a `try` / `finally`) so dot-repeat records the keystrokes of the last
change regardless of which branch handles them. The branch order is a
strict precedence: pending state is always consumed before normal-mode keys,
which is why `f.`, `r.`, and `d.` take `.` as their argument rather than as
a repeat.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    input["handleInput(data)"] --> hook["ensureOnChangeHook()"]
    hook --> exnorm{"pendingExCommand != null?"}
    exnorm -- yes --> exwait["normalizePendingExCommandInput<br/>(paste / newline wait policy)"]
    exnorm -- no --> notinsert{"mode != insert?"}
    notinsert -- yes --> paste["strip bracketed paste in normal mode"]
    notinsert -- no --> recwrap
    exwait --> recwrap
    paste --> recwrap["prepareRepeatRecordingForInput<br/>try / finally finishRepeatRecordingAfterInput"]
    recwrap --> esc{"escape-like?"}
    esc -- yes --> doEsc["handleEscape()"]
    esc -- no --> ins{"mode == insert?"}
    ins -- yes --> doIns["alt-key shims, else super.handleInput"]
    ins -- no --> rep{"pendingReplace?"}
    rep -- yes --> doRep["r{char}"]
    rep -- no --> exd{"pendingExCommand?"}
    exd -- yes --> doEx["handlePendingExCommand"]
    exd -- no --> tobj{"pendingTextObject?"}
    tobj -- yes --> doTobj["handlePendingTextObject"]
    tobj -- no --> mot{"pendingMotion?"}
    mot -- yes --> doMot["handlePendingMotion"]
    mot -- no --> op{"pendingOperator d/c/y?"}
    op -- yes --> doOp["handlePendingDelete / Change / Yank"]
    op -- no --> vis{"visual mode?"}
    vis -- yes --> doVis["handleVisualMode<br/>consumes v V o d x y c s D X Y C S<br/>and the inert keys"]
    doVis -- "not consumed<br/>(motions, counts)" --> normal
    vis -- no --> normal["handleNormalMode"]
```

`handleVisualMode` returns a boolean rather than owning the whole key
space: motions and counts deliberately fall through to `handleNormalMode`,
so a visual selection resizes using exactly the same motion code paths as
normal mode. It also declines to consume anything while `pendingG` or
`pendingMotion` is set, which keeps `vgg` and `vfx` working.

### EX mini-mode dispatch

`:` in normal mode calls `startPendingExCommand()`, seeding the buffer with
`":"`. Subsequent keys append through `handlePendingExCommand` (with the
paste/newline wait policy applied in the pre-pass, so a pasted newline is
truncated away rather than submitting). `Esc` cancels; a **typed** `Enter` —
the only thing that can submit — calls `submitPendingExCommand()`, which
resolves the line in a fixed precedence order:

1. strip the leading `:`, trim, and detect a trailing `!` (force);
2. if the name is a reserved quit name (`q`, `qa`, `quit`, `qall`,
   `quitall`), quit — guarding a non-empty prompt unless forced;
3. split the remainder into `name` and verbatim `args` on the first
   whitespace run;
4. if `name` is in `EX_RESERVED_NAMES` (held for future vim ex semantics),
   surface a "Reserved ex command" notice — never dispatch;
5. if `piDispatch` is on and `name` is a known Pi command, dispatch it;
6. otherwise surface an "Unsupported ex command" notice.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Enter["typed Enter"] --> Quit{"quit name?"}
  Quit -- yes --> DoQuit["quitFn (guard non-empty prompt)"]
  Quit -- no --> Reserved{"in EX_RESERVED_NAMES?"}
  Reserved -- yes --> Notice["notify: Reserved ex command"]
  Reserved -- no --> Known{"piDispatch AND known Pi command?"}
  Known -- yes --> Dispatch["dispatchSlashCommand(name, args)"]
  Known -- no --> Unsupported["notify: Unsupported ex command"]
```

### the pi-command bridge

Pi exposes no public command-dispatch API, so `dispatchSlashCommand` reuses
the one mechanism that reaches every command kind: the editor's own submit
path. `:name args` becomes `/name args` in the buffer, then `onSubmit` runs —
byte-for-byte what happens when the user types the slash command themselves.
Two seams keep that coupling injectable and testable without a live runtime:

| seam | default | supplied at `session_start` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `setRunCommandFn` | `setText(line)` then `onSubmit(line)` | not overridden (the editor owns its submit) |
| `setCommandNamesFn` | the mirrored builtin names | union of builtins and `pi.getCommands()` |
| `setExCommandSettings` | dispatch on, clipboard copy off | `resolveExCommandSettings` |

`getCommands()` is called inside the thunk, so the known-command set is
recomputed on every submit and a command registered mid-session is reachable.
Pi's builtin list is not re-exported from the package entry point, so
`EX_BUILTIN_COMMAND_NAMES` mirrors it; a name missing from that mirror simply
falls through to "unsupported".

Every dispatch route clears the prompt buffer, and no command reads that buffer
as an argument. So `dispatchSlashCommand` brackets the call with the same
`captureSnapshot` / `restoreSnapshot` pair the dot-repeat rollback uses,
restoring text *and* cursor in a `finally`. Both of Pi's routes clear
synchronously before their first `await`, so the restore wins; a route that
cleared after an `await` would defeat it, which is what the opt-in
`copyInputToClipboard` setting exists to cover.

Restoring the text is not enough on its own. The dispatch's own `setText("")`
is a buffer mutation the user never typed, and it leaves three traces: an entry
on the host editor's undo stack, a cleared redo stack, and a cleared repeatable
command (both via the `setText` override). Left alone, the first `u` after any
`:command` would be silently swallowed undoing the dispatch's churn. So the
`finally` also pops the undo stack back to its pre-dispatch depth and restores
`redoStack` and `lastRepeatableCommand`. The invariant worth remembering: a
dispatch is transparent to the buffer, the cursor, undo, redo, and `.`.

## where the larger behaviors live in `index.ts`

- **undo / redo**: snapshot capture/restore + a `redoStack`; `performUndo`
  / `performRedo` around the host editor's own history.
- **dot-repeat**: a keystroke recorder (`repeatRecording`) captured by the
  dispatch wrap; `repeatLastCommand` replays the recorded key stream, with
  a snapshot rollback if a replay fails. The recorder is disabled in visual
  mode, and `applyVisualOperator` calls `clearRepeatState()` so a later `.`
  cannot replay a normal-mode command the user has moved past.
- **visual mode**: `visualAnchor` plus `this.mode`; `applyVisualOperator`
  resolves the selection through `visual.ts` and then reuses the existing
  `deleteRangeByAbsolute` / `yankRangeByAbsolute` / `deleteLineRange` /
  `yankLineRange` primitives, so `Vd` and `dd` share their cursor
  behaviour (and their known nvim divergence).
- **put / register**: `unnamedRegister` plus the clipboard-mirror policy;
  `putAfter` / `putBefore` handle char-wise vs line-wise placement.
- **render**: `render()` composes lines, fits the mode label
  (`mode-label.ts`), applies mode colorizers (`mode-colors.ts`), and syncs
  the cursor shape (`cursor-shape.ts`) — the cursor-shape write is the one
  side effect on the render path.

## testing model

- `npm test` runs `test/**/*.test.ts` on Node's built-in runner — unit
  tests over the pure modules and the class's observable behavior.
- `npm run test:nvim` runs the parity suites (`test/nvim-parity-*.ts`),
  which drive real headless nvim and compare text / cursor / mode /
  register, pinning pi-vim's behavior to the reference editor.
- `test/**` is excluded from the npm package, so tests never affect the
  `pack:check` size budget.
